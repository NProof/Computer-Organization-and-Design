### Introduction
* To command a computer's hardware
  * Instructions: ths words of a Computer's language
  * Instruction set: vocabulary of a computer's language
* Computer languages are quite similar
  * All computers are constrcted from hardware technolgies based on similar underlying principles
  * There are a few basic operations that all computers must provide
  * A common goal for computer designers
    * To find a language that makes it easy to build the hardware and the compiler
    * To maximize performance and minimize cost and energy
 Â * MIPS instruction set
  * Stored-program concept
    * instuctions and data of many types can be stored in memory as numbers
    
### Operatrions-of-the-Computer-Hardware
* MIPS arithmetic instruction
  * add/sub a,b,c
